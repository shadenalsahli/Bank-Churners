# Bank Churners ![python-logo@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58245598/187809701-ea59eb12-55f2-4e9d-a904-530259a0277b.png)


The problem of frequently opening and closing credit cards to gain cash, rewards points is known as credit card churning. The business sector and customer relationship affect the outcome of how churning customers are detected. So, we need a system to predict credit card churning, with a dataset of customer labels with 1 for the customer is likely to churn and 0 otherwise. Also, a supervised learning binary classification model to predict if a given account is a churn or not.
In this project, I used an updated version of the BankChurners dataset in Kaggle. The dataset consists of nearly 10,000 customers with 23 features, stating their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. Moreover, I drop unnecessary features that will not affect the training phase.

## Preprocces Notebook

Pre-processing the dataset features correctly before building the model and visualizing the dataset.

## Model Notebook

Build two different machine learning models using two different approaches (MLP and XGBClassifier).
